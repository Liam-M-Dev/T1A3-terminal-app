    Hello and welcome to haiku creator
    This terminal app allows you to create your own haiku poems.
    
    So what is a haiku you ask?
    A haiku is a small poem consisting of 3 lines and 17 syllables,
    depicting a moment of insight followed by a moment of observation.

    You can create your haiku in the create a haiku option.
    The logic will then determine if it follows the basic rule of:
    5 syllables in the first and third line, 7 syllables in the second.

    You can also view and edit your files in the saved file option.
    For extra fun, try the jumble option to jumble your haiku's in
    the selected file!
